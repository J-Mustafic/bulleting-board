# Tika Board

## About

I started working on this app as a part of learning the ReactJS framework. It is still in early stage with minimal features implemented.

Feel free to provide feedback and any issues you encounter.
At some point in development, I would like for more developers to join in.

## Versions
### Latest version

Latest working version is deployed to the Heroku. Feel free to check it out. Feedback is more than welcome.

### Development version

As often as I can I will add new features, and deploy them to Firebase. Current version in development you can check out here.
